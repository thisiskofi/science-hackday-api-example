# science-hackday-api-example
A jupyter notebook demonstrating some of the capabilities of Microsoft's computer vision API.

## Getting started
The easiest way to get python and jupyter noteook up and running is to download and install [Anaconda Python](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
#### CV2
The python OpenCV package can often be difficult to install, especially for MacOS. The best way to do that is as follows. In a terminal window, type:
```
conda install -c https://conda.binstar.org/menpo opencv
```
#### Running the notebook
To run the notebook once Python and OpenCV are installed, from the terminal first `cd` to the folder containing the notebook (.ipynb file), and then type:
```
jupyter notebook
```
You should then see a browser window/tab listing the files in the folder from which you launched the jupyter app. Click on the Hack Day notebook and you should ge good to go!
